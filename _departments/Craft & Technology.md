##### Design & Technology Unit (D&T)
In D&T, students learn through design-and-make projects guided by a design process. The design process entails identifying design needs from real-world experiences, generating and developing ideas, and prototyping the design solution, with research carried out when necessary. In doing so, students acquire related knowledge and develop skills to turn ideas into meaningful and purposeful artefacts as well as cultivating values like mindfulness, empathy, and sensitivity in the areas of social, cultural and environmental domains.

**Signature Programmes:**
* **Applied Learning Programme (ALP) (Design Thinking)** <br>
The D&T Unit supports the school’s ALP programme by equipping lower secondary students with the required Design Thinking skills in terms of empathising, defining, ideating, prototyping and testing of their problem identification and solution making process.  Hence, students have the opportunity to actualize their proposed ideas. In addition, these skills are applied when they participate in the various national competitions or make presentations to VIPs, for example during the 2018 Tech Saturday (Upsized) organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).

* **Broadrick Digital Intelligence (DI) Programme** <br>
The D&T Unit also supports the Broadrick Digital Intelligence (DI) Programme in developing our students to be competent digital natives. The school partners with IMDA to train Secondary Ones on the use of ‘Code For Fun’ programming to design a meaningful product using the micro: bit. The main objective of this programme is to equip a new generation to be creative with technology and take advantage of the opportunities in terms of careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

* **Learning Journey to East Zone Center of Excellence** <br>
The D&T Unit organises an annual learning journey to the East Zone Center of Excellence to enrich students’ learning experience in D&T.

* **Coaching Students from Partner School in the Application of Design Thinking** <br>
Students from the Upper Secondary level have the opportunity to coach and mentor a group of Primary Five students from Haig Girls Primary School on how to make use of the Design Thinking process to identify and solve authentic problems.
