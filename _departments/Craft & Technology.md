<h2><strong>Art Unit</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Our Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>As part of our mission to provide a holistic education that enables Broadricians
to perceive, communicate, and appreciate art, we must integrate art into
every aspect of our curriculum. Not only are art classes required, but
they must also include artistic expression in subjects such as history.
The students will gain a deeper understanding of art's role in society
and culture, improve their creativity, and improve their communication
skills. By exposing students to a variety of art forms—from traditional
to contemporary—they will gain a deeper appreciation for art. Our goal
is to empower Broadricians with the skills and knowledge to engage meaningfully
with art throughout their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enrichment Programme on Digital Arts</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Participating in a digital art program will foster creativity, technical
proficiency, and a thorough understanding of contemporary artistic tools.
These skills are nurtured through guided instruction and hands-on exploration
in Broadrick Secondary School's digital art enrichment program.</p>
