<p>At Secondary 1, students will take part in a series of ALP activities
conducted by the Science teachers with support from the Science Centre
STEM Inc. Besides learning about systems and understanding what STEM is
all about, students will have hands-on experience constructing a prototype
using recyclable materials to showcase their learning. Our students will
also learn about the design thinking process which has been weaved into
the D&amp;T curriculum, allowing them to explore and be innovative while
at the same time honing their decision making skills.</p>
<p>At Secondary 2, students will continue their ALP journey to learn more
about the importance of sustainability, renewable energy and their impact
on our planet. Students are given opportunities to apply their learning
in project work settings to solve authentic problems, make logical analysis
and resolve conflicts as a team. Students will also have the opportunity
to perform experiential learning on how technology is being used to solve
real life energy related problems.</p>
<p>At Secondary 3, students who exhibit talent and interest through their
distinctive and creative prototypes are given more in-depth exposure to
business planning, business ethics and design thinking. These students
will then take part in innovative and entrepreneurship related competitions
to stretch their potential in the spirit of achieving excellence in creativity
and entrepreneur dare. Students are offered opportunities to go for job
shadowing at local and overseas’ companies in STEM related fields. Through
these opportunities, students get to experience the working world of today
and bring back these experiences to share with their peers, enhancing the
motivation for students to find out more about their areas of interest
and better plan their future studies and career choices.future studies
and career choices.</p>
