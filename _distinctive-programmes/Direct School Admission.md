##### 2022 DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION INTO SECONDARY SCHOOLS (DSA-SEC) for Admission to Secondary 1 in 2023

**DSA-Sec Talent Offered** <br>
In broadening and deepening student learning, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to nurture entrepreneurship, as well as critical and inventive thinking in students. Our “Entrepreneurship in STEM” programme aims to help our students become inquisitive leaders and critical and creative thinkers who embrace a spirit of creativity and enterprise.

Our ALP is closely aligned to the school’s vision of nurturing future-ready learners with strength of character. Through authentic learning experiences, students will foster a spirit of creativity and an enterprising mind-set. Students will develop thinking skills and dispositions through collaborative activities, scientific inquiry, basic coding, automation and design thinking to help them be change makers in the field of renewable energy and sustainable living. 

Our students have benefited greatly from the programme. Amongst their achievements in other challenges and competitions, some of our students have gone on to claim the Best Go-to-Market Award as well as the Best Innovation (Technology) Award at the Youth Innovation Challenge 2018. One of our teams also clinched the spot of National Champions at the SHELL Bright Ideas Challenge 2018.Our teams also clinched the spot of National Champions at the SHELL Bright Ideas Challenge in 2018 and 2019.

DSA students will be placed under our Talent Management Programme (TMP) where they will take part in external workshops and competitions to showcase their creativity and entrepreneurial dare. There are also opportunities for students to serve a short attachment to local and overseas companies in STEM related fields. The ALP programme would hone students’ hard and soft-skills, preparing them to be future-ready learners.
