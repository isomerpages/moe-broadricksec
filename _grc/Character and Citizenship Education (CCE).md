<h4>Sexuality Education</h4>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as
the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
