Those who aspire glory in the uniformed groups have the NCC Land, NPCC, Red Cross and Girl Guides to choose from. Broadrick Secondary Uniformed Groups develop a sense of pride, duty, loyalty, discipline, integrity and courage through the various activities our uniformed group members engage in. These values define their characters and instil in them the moral compass to be outstanding citizens who will significantly contribute to their families and nation-building in the very near future.
