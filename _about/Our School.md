<h3>School Crest</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The School Crest reflects the school colours. The cogwheel in the centre
symbolises the school’s continuous strive for progress and development
as it undertakes its mission to educate; the basic aim is represented by
the open book. The torch represents our students’ commitment to life-long
learning. The four rings reflect the multi-racial composition of the school
community as it grows, learns and develop together as one united community.
The concept of the school as a family is reinforced by the four inter-twinning
rings.</p>
<h3>School Flag</h3>

</div>
<p>The school flag comprises two main colours – white and dark blue. The
dark blue panels in the background represent our teachers and staff who
are always ready to nurture and support our students in their pursuit to
achieve academic and non-academic excellence. The white colour in the centre
signifies the youth and receptivity of our students. The richness of the
colour white points to the numerous possibilities opened to our students
as they take their positions as adult citizens and contributing members
of the community and beyond.</p>
