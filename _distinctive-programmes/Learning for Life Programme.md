In Broadrick Secondary School, we are strongly committed to delivering holistic education to our students. The Learning for Life Programme at Broadrick Secondary School seeks to nurture Confidence And REsilience (CARE) through Aesthetic, Community and Youth Leadership.

To be future-ready learners with strength of character, our students are given opportunities to discover themselves and build confidence and resilience to face a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world. We believe that through their exposure in aesthetics and service learning, they will experience deep introspection of selves, find their passion and sense of purpose as they learn new skills, interact with people and serve the community.

##### Programme Design
The LLP is implemented in two tiers. All students will have the opportunity to experience Tier 1 programmes, as these are structured into the school curriculum. Students who have shown aptitude and interest in the domain and those who step forward to volunteer to participate are offered Tier 2 programmes, where there are additional platforms and opportunities to work with the community.

Tier 1 programmes and experiences are curated to allow knowledge and skills to be applied to subsequent LLP experiences in later years. For example, a student will learn how to play a ukulele in Secondary 1 and learn about project management in Secondary 2. He/she may then use these skills in planning projects or putting up performances as they plan and carry out Service Learning projects in Secondary 3. 

Below is a snapshot of what our students can expect from our Tier 1 LLP experience.

**Sec 1 LLP Experience** <br>
Our Secondary 1 students are exposed to performing skills such as the Ukelele and percussion instruments and they learn various elements of arts through the aesthetic programme.

They are given platforms to develop team-building skills and get to serve the school through recycling and upcycling efforts.

**Sec 2 LLP Experience** <br>
Built in to the curriculum, we help our Secondary 2 students to deepen their appreciation of music and art through both theory lessons and enrichment courses. Students are given opportunities to learn how to write their own songs and create artwork through different techniques and with different materials.

Students will also learn about project management and plan outreach activities to engage kindergarten students. Every student gets to work collaboratively with their teams, learn how to overcome challenges and build their confidence as they interact with their younger peers. 

**Sec 3 LLP Experience** <br>
Our Secondary 3 students are guided to take greater ownership and initiate Service Learning projects to contribute to a cause they strongly believe in.

Below are some examples of projects our students were involved in.
