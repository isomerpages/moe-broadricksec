<h4><strong>(B) Device Management Application (DMA)</strong></h4>
<p>In rolling out Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) for students, MOE is acutely
aware of concerns regarding students’ cyber wellness.</p>
<p>A DMA will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school
and will be installed on any student-owned devices parents/guardians opt
for the student to use in lieu of the PLD, subject to parental/guardian
consent.</p>
<p>The Device Management Application (DMA) solution for Chromebook PLDs is
LightSpeed Systems®.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>During school hours, the Default Setting will apply.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in
the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Classroom Management Service</strong>. To help
teachers manage students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve
classroom management and support effective teaching and learning by collecting
data on usage by the student, such as the websites accessed on the PLD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile Device Management Service</strong>. To
help update and manage the PLD, protect the PLD from malicious software,
and protects students from objectionable internet content by monitoring,
filtering, and limiting the type of websites accessible to the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Usage Management Service</strong>. To enable school
and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for
students’ use of PLD after school by placing restrictions on students’
screen time to prevent cyber addiction.</p>
