<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p><strong>Parents Gateway (PG)</strong> is an initiative by the Ministry
of Education (MOE) to enable parents to interact more conveniently with
schools on administrative and financial matters. Through this mobile application,
parents can also stay updated on the schoolâ€™s programmes and activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One useful feature in PG is the <strong>School Calendar of Events</strong>,
where you can view key dates and upcoming activities at Broadrick Secondary
School. To help you navigate the app with ease, we have prepared a <strong>step-by-step guide</strong> for
parents.</p>
<p>ðŸ“¸ <strong>Please refer to the image below</strong> for detailed instructions
on how to locate the School Calendar within the PG app and stay updated
on Broadrickâ€™s upcoming events and activities.</p>
