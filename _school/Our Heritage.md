As Singapore’s central area became increasingly crowded in the 1950s, the colonial government planned to develop a new public housing estate in the Kallang Airport area. The Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) – predecessor of the Housing Development Board (HDB) – built low-rise flats at Dakota Crescent in 1958. Upon completion in 1959, the new Kallang Airport estate had 2,936 housing units equipped with modern basic services such as piped water, flush toilets and electricity. Interestingly, Dakota Crescent was the first estate to feature one-room flats. A significant number of these flats were used to rehouse victims from the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire in 1961.

At the time of writing, Tian Kee at Block 12 Dakota Crescent served as a cosy café but prior to its conversion, it housed a provision shop which served the neighbourhood for 54 years. When the Tian Kee provision shop shut its doors and made way for the current café, it stood as one of the oldest of its kind in Singapore. In the past, children bought titbits, avid joggers stopped to hydrate themselves with cold drinks and residents purchased essentials such as cooking oil and bread. However, business at the provision shop was adversely affected after a supermarket opened across the street. Rising rents and decrease in number of residents in Dakota also made it hard to cope.

The roads, Dakota Close and Dakota Crescent, located in the former Singapore Improvement Trust estate at the Old Kallang Airport, were given their names in 1957. These were named after the famous all-metal passenger aircraft of the 1930s, the Douglas DC-3, or Dakota. Dakota Crescent, off Old Airport Road, was part of the Kallang Airport.

One of Singapore’s oldest rivers, the Geylang River cuts through Mountbatten into the Tanjong Katong area. The mouth of the river was once a bustling area of firewood trading. Neighbourhood children used to climb down the low concrete walls to catch fish and crabs during low tides in the muddy river. However, floods would descend upon Mountbatten area and Tanjong Katong during high tides. Thus, in 1994, the river was redeveloped into a U-shaped, reinforced concrete canal. The Geylang River was later revitalised in a two-year project and reopened in January 2014. The Geylang Park Connector which runs along the river is popular with strollers and joggers.

The school was officially opened by Mr Joseph Francis Conceicao, the then Member of Parliament for Katong, on 14 March 1969. In January 1996, Broadrick Secondary School merged with Maju Secondary School to become a single session school. The school later moved to its current location at 61 Dakota Crescent in 2005 and was officially opened by Dr Yaacob Ibrahim on 20 July 2007.  On 2 January 2011, Broadrick Secondary School merged with Telok Kurau Secondary School.
