##### Design & Technology Unit (D&T)
In D&T, students learn through design-and-make projects guided by a design process. The design process entails identifying design needs from real-world experiences, generating and developing ideas, and prototyping the design solution, with research carried out when necessary. In doing so, students acquire related knowledge and develop skills to turn ideas into meaningful and purposeful artefacts as well as cultivating values like mindfulness, empathy, and sensitivity in the areas of social, cultural and environmental domains.

**Signature Programmes:**
* **Applied Learning Programme (ALP) (Design Thinking)** <br>
The D&T Unit supports the school’s ALP programme by equipping lower secondary students with the required Design Thinking skills in terms of empathising, defining, ideating, prototyping and testing of their problem identification and solution making process.  Hence, students have the opportunity to actualize their proposed ideas. In addition, these skills are applied when they participate in the various national competitions or make presentations to VIPs, for example during the 2018 Tech Saturday (Upsized) organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).

* **Broadrick Digital Intelligence (DI) Programme** <br>
The D&T Unit also supports the Broadrick Digital Intelligence (DI) Programme in developing our students to be competent digital natives. The school partners with IMDA to train Secondary Ones on the use of ‘Code For Fun’ programming to design a meaningful product using the micro: bit. The main objective of this programme is to equip a new generation to be creative with technology and take advantage of the opportunities in terms of careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

* **Learning Journey to East Zone Center of Excellence** <br>
The D&T Unit organises an annual learning journey to the East Zone Center of Excellence to enrich students’ learning experience in D&T.

##### Nutrition and Food Science Unit (NFS)
To empower students to make informed decisions as discerning consumers

**Signature Programmes:**
* **Lower Secondary – Supermarket Tour** <br>
Secondary Ones take a guided tour through the supermarket aisles with FCE teachers to discover various tips in making economical and healthy food choices.
* **Lower Secondary – In-Vend My Meal!** <br>
The NFS unit collaborated with Chef-in-Box (JR Vending) to promote a greater awareness in Food Innovation and Technology.  The objective of this programme is to nurture our students to be future-ready learners. Hence, as part of their alternative assessment, FCE students are tasked to design and create a healthy fusion dish that is suited for dispensing from vending machines.

**Ensure this caption is together with the pic:** Chef Kim Dong Suk, an international award-winning from Seoul, Korea was invited to share the process in making a signature Korean dish, Bibimbap. The students had a light-hearted dialogue session with the chef to learn more about what it takes to be a successful chef.

* **Lower Secondary – Ice-cream making workshop** <br> Secondary One NT students are engaged in an ice-cream making workshop as part of their enrichment programme. Through this hands-on activity, the students have fun while learning the process of ice cream-making as well as the effects of impurities during the freezing process.

* **Upper Secondary – Food Science and Sensory Evaluation workshop** <br>
Secondary Three Express students attend a 3-hour workshop in Temasek Polytechnic (School of Applied Sciences) to discover more about common food starches. They experimente with different food starches and observe its thickening and freezing properties under different conditions. They also conduct a sensory evaluation of the various starch formulations in the sensory evaluation room.
