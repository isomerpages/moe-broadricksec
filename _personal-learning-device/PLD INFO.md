<h5><strong>(B) Device Management Application (DMA)</strong></h5>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In rolling out Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) for students, MOE is acutely
aware of concerns regarding students’ cyber wellness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>DMA</strong> will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through
the school and will be installed on any student-owned devices parents/guardians
opt for the student to use in lieu of the PLD, subject to parental/guardian
consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Device Management Application (DMA) solution for Chromebook PLDs is
LightSpeed Systems®.&nbsp;&nbsp;During school hours, the Default Setting
will apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in
the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Classroom Management Service</u>. To help teachers manage
students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management
and support effective teaching and learning by collecting data on usage
by the student, such as the websites accessed on the PLD.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Mobile Device Management Service</u>. To help update
and manage the PLD, protect the PLD from malicious software, and protects
students from objectionable internet content by monitoring, filtering,
and limiting the type of websites accessible to the student.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Usage Management Service</u>. To enable school and/or
parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’
use of PLD after school by placing restrictions on students’ screen time
to prevent cyber addiction.</p>
