<p>Broadrick Secondary School's LLP aims to nurture Grateful, Respectful,
and Compassionate (GRC) Leaders through service in the community. It takes
reference from our school’s GRC Values and is aligned to the school’s mission
of nurturing Broadricians to be future-ready learners with strength of
character.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We have themes for the different levels to expose
students to the different areas of service.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In Secondary 1, the theme is on environment, and students learn about
community needs through information shared by the Municipal Services Office
(MSO). They then take action to address these needs. Collaborating with
our partner school Dunman High, the Sec 1 students are rostered by class
to maintain the cleanliness of our neighbourhood. In the process, they
learn to be respectful towards the cleaners and grateful for the clean
environment they live in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Secondary 2 Values In Action (VIA) experience, the theme is on
youth, and our students design, plan, and host students from Kong Hwa School
for a day of enriching and fun activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Sec 3 VIA whereby the theme is on elderly, the school partners
ActiveSG for the students to conduct modified sports activities for the
elderly. All these level-based VIA experiences avail opportunities for
students to develop their identity, character and leadership qualities.&nbsp;
We want our students to learn to understand the needs of the elderly living
in the vicinity and to develop compassion and emotional connection with
those whom they serve, which include the younger peers in kindergarten
and primary schools.&nbsp; As they develop their social emotional competencies,
they also have a greater sense of purpose and in control of their own learning,
thereby strengthening their personal and interpersonal leadership qualities.</p>
