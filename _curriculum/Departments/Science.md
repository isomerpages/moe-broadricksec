<p>Sec 3 students have the opportunity to participate in a 2-week Young Sustainability
Champion (YSC) as part of Science Centre’s (STEM) mentoring programmes.</p>
<p>The team of students apply design thinking to develop a deep empathy of
real-life community based challenges related to the United Nation Sustainable

<p><strong>Knowledge Building Design Studio&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will have the opportunity to think about sustainability issues
that they care about for the community at large and collaborate and learn
from students from other secondary schools and NIE researchers to design,
share on innovative ideas to tackle sustainability solutions.</p>
<p>The students will practice Knowledge Building principles where they were
introduced to idea generation and learning to share and learning from others
to improve ideas for tangible solutions for a better sustainable world
for all.</p>
<p>This programme helped to incorporate the values of gratitude, respect
and compassion for the community and the living world and helped to fosters
a holistic approach to environmental stewardship.</p>
