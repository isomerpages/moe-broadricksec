<h3>Full Subject-Based Banding</h3>
<p>Broadrick Secondary School has implemented Full Subject-Based Banding
(FSBB) from 2022. With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education,
with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs.</p>
<p>This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise
the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence
and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>A - Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2</strong></h4>
<p>Our school will provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities
subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.
This is applicable to students who are in the Secondary 2 Normal (Academic)
course from 2022, and students who are in the Normal (Technical) course
from 2023.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Eligible students from the 2021 Secondary 1 Normal (Academic) cohort who
are promoted to the same course in 2022 will be able to offer Geography,
History or Literature at a more demanding level. With this increased flexibility
in customising our students’ learning experiences, we are better able to
recognise their strengths and nurture their intrinsic motivation to learn.
Students who wish to be considered to offer Geography, History or Literature
at a more demanding level will have to meet subject-specific criteria in
Secondary 1. They should also possess positive attitude towards learning
and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.</p>
<h4><strong>B - Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Our school will implement mixed form classes at Secondary 1. This is applicable
to Secondary 1 students entering our school in 2022. The 2022 cohort of
Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising
students from all courses of study. Students will attend lessons in the
form classes for the following subjects: Character and Citizenship Education,
Music, Physical Education, Art, Design &amp;amp; Technology, as well as
Food and Consumer Education. For the academic subjects, namely English,
Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, Science, and the Humanities, students
will be attending lessons based on their subject classes.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The subject classes will be organised based on their respective course
levels (G1, G2, G3). The common learning experience through the mixed form
classes creates a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful
friendships, and appreciate different perspectives.&amp;nbsp;</p>
