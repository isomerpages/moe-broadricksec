We believe that ICT provides opportunities for active learning in the various subjects and development of 21st Century competencies whereby students engage in activities that promote analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of content in areas such as reading, writing, discussion, and problem-solving.

At the core of our ICT framework is realising our vision of nurturing future-ready and responsible digital learners.Â  This vision is incorporated in our four areas: leadership and support, design & delivery, development & exploration and assessment & analysis.
