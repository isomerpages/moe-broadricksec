<h3><strong>Principal's Message</strong></h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/IMG_9923.jpeg"></div><h4>As we bid 2023 goodbye and welcome 2024, I am encouraged and thankful as well as filled with much anticipation and expectation.&nbsp; Taking over the baton and helming Broadrick has been most gratifying as I have received tremendous support from the various stakeholders. &nbsp;Last year, our focus was envisioning Broadrick’s new season. &nbsp;During the course of the year, I shared my dreams and vision for Broadrick through various platforms and I am heartened to update that we start 2024 with a shared vision and enhanced values. &nbsp;Valuing every stakeholder’s voice, we invited and collaborated with staff, students, parents, School Advisory Committee, Broadrick Alumni and community partners to share their views to carve a distinctive Broadrician identity. &nbsp;The work was tedious but the discussions were rich and the collective effort was worth the time and energy as we emerge with one united voice. Thus, I am truly grateful and appreciative for the commitment and strong support of all stakeholders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4><p>So, moving on to a new year – 2024, Broadrick will commence our new season and new journey.&nbsp; This year, we will embark on carrying out the plans to nurture future ready learners with strength of character and to be a choice school for both students and parents. &nbsp;To achieve this end, the revised and enhanced values - GRC (Gratitude, Respect &amp; Compassion) serve as a beacon for every Broadrician in his/her thoughts, words and actions. &nbsp;We have put in place structures and programmes that are aligned to the school’s Vision, Mission and Values. Therefore, be ready for some innovative changes.</p><p>A major change will be the revamped timetable. &nbsp;The revised timetable aims to encourage and support students to take ownership of their own learning, to become self-directed and independent learners working towards meaningful goals. &nbsp;This will prepare them for the future, to be effective in a disruptive and <strong>VUCA </strong>(<strong>V</strong>olatile, <strong>U</strong>ncertain, <strong>C</strong>omplex, <strong>A</strong>mbiguous) world. &nbsp;The new timetable structure incorporates multiple whitespace slots (flexible time slots) to allow students to pace their own learning as well as to seize the opportunities to grow and develop beyond the confines of the curriculum and syllabus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLs%20in%20garden.jpeg"></div><p></p><p>The other major change is for Broadricians to cultivate, embody and demonstrate <strong>GRC</strong>. &nbsp;<strong>GRC </strong>is the foundation of cultivating long-lasting values and a testament to students’ strength of character. &nbsp;We are confident that with the refined co-curricular plans, students will naturally exhibit gratitude to their parents, respect to their teachers and compassion to the community. &nbsp;</p><p>So, 2024 will be an exciting new year as we work together, all the stakeholders, in close partnership to bring about A Choice School providing Holistic Education as we nurture Broadricians to be Future-Ready Learners with Strength of Character.</p><p>Let’s make BRD fly together.</p><p></p><p>Mr Ng Tiong Nam</p><p>Principal</p><p></p><p><em>A&nbsp;Dynamic School providing Holistic Education as&nbsp;we Nurture Broadricians to be Future-Ready&nbsp;Learners with Strength of Character</em></p><hr><hr><p></p>
