<p>At Broadrick, we guide our students to demonstrate Gratitude, Respect,
and Compassion at home, in school, and throughout the community.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>GRC Connection Day</h4>
<p>GRC Connection Day at Broadrick Secondary School is a vibrant celebration
of our core values—Gratitude, Respect and Compassion. Held on the last
day of each term, this event brings the entire school together in a spirit
of unity and purpose. Through engaging activities, reflective conversations,
and heartwarming moments, students reconnect with one another, their teachers,
and the values that define us as Broadricians. It is more than just a day—it
is a meaningful pause to celebrate and affirm all good efforts, forge deeper
bonds and strengthen the soul of our school community. A day to remember,
always.</p>

<h4>GRC Banquet</h4>
<p>The GRC Banquet celebrates excellence in the values of Gratitude, Respect,
and Compassion, bringing together students, parents, and community partners
to honour achievements and positive contributions in these areas. The evening
features awards for outstanding classes, CCAs, and students, along with
performances from the Visual Performing Arts CCAs. Some of our staff and
students leverage this platform to live our school motto, ’Ready to Serve’,
as they join the professional waiters to serve the sit down meal to our
beloved guests.</p>
