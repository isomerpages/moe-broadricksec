<p><strong>Dear Sec 1 Students,</strong>
</p>
<p>Congratulations on your posting to Broadrick Secondary School to begin
your secondary school education. It will be a new phase of your development
and we are happy to welcome you into our Broadrick family!
<br>

Exercise online.</p>

1 Online Registration. Broadrick Secondary School will be automatically
reflected on Parents Gateway once you have received your school posting.</p>

be using the Parents Gateway (PG) to disseminate important information.
We strongly encourage parents/guardians to go onboard PG. If you do not
have a PG account, please download the Parents Gateway App on the Apple
App Store or the GooglePlay Store and sign up for an account with your
SingPass before posting results are released.</p>
