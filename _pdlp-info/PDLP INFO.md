##### Device Management Application (DMA)

In rolling out Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) for students, MOE is acutely aware of concerns regarding students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA allows the school and parents to manage this, by
* collecting data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent on each application, 
* monitoring, filtering, and limiting the type of websites accessible to the student, and
* placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent cyber addiction.

| Default | Option A | Option B |
|---|---|---|
| MOE/school DMA setting will continue after school hours | Parents can determine DMA settings after school hours | Parents can choose to disable DMA after school hours |
| For parents who want their child to be restricted only to teaching and learning, and prefer to leave it to the school / MOE to decide on the DMA settings both during school and after school hours | For parents who want more leeway over the use of the device, and want to take charge of the level of restrictions for their child's use of the device after school hours. | For parents who do not want their child's use of the device to be regulated by DMA after school. |
| School Hours: 7.30 - 16.00<br>After School Hours: 16.00 - 22.30  | School Hours: 7.30 - 16.00<br>After School Hours: <br>Parents Determine   | School Hours: 7.30 - 16.00<br>After School Hours: No DMA |
