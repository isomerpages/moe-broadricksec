MOE has launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. At Broadrick, every student will be using a Chrombook Convertible for teaching and learning. The school will make arrangements for you to purchase the PLD for your child’s/ward’s use in school. The vendor has been identified based on the choice of device determined by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The PLD bundle includes a warranty and insurance.
