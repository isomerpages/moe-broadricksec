### Vision &amp; Mission
* To develop students into creative thinkers and effective problem-solvers.

### Mission  
* To provide students with a strong foundation in Mathematical concepts and skills
* To stretch students' Mathematical ability to the fullest through innovative teaching.
* To cultivate a positive attitude, passion and perseverance in learning Mathematics for our students (values of passion and perseverance).

### Signature Programmes
The Mathematics Department designs level enrichment programmes, catering to the needs, interests and profiles of the students at each level, to provide a holistic and comprehensive experience in numeracy.&nbsp; These enrichment programmes are aimed at&nbsp;
* encouraging students to appreciate the beauty and relevance of Mathematics in real world and other disciplines, and    
* encouraging students to work collaboratively in teams.

* For Secondary One students, the Sudoku Enrichment promotes logical thinking and problem solving in a fun way as they work through the number grids.&nbsp; Through this experience, students realise how numbers are used for recreational purposes.  
* For Secondary Two students, they experience first-hand how numbers are important in a real-life setting through a Learning Journey â€“ Sec 2 Math Trail @ Changi.&nbsp; Working in teams, they have to navigate Changi Airport amenities to complete the trail.&nbsp; This experience exposes them to logical thinking and problem solving skills as they attempt to overcome the obstacles encountered along the way.&nbsp; Thus, they learn to appreciate to appreciate the value of Mathematics as a tool to tackle real-world problems.  
* For Secondary Three students, a Discovery Math Day is organised where we bring some real-world application of Math into the school for students to experience.&nbsp; Having a better grasp of the various mathematical concepts at Secondary 3, students then explore the Mathematics discipline and its application to the real world at a deeper level.
