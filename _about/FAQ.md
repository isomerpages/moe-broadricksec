<p>Are students allowed to bring mobile phones to school?
<br>Please refer to the Broadrick Secondary School Student Handbook on the
use of mobile phones in Broadrick Secondary School.</p>
<p>Does my child need to buy a laptop/mobile device as part of school programme
when he/she joins Broadrick Secondary School?
<br>MOE has launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) to help
students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the
NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme
(PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school
student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by
end-2021. At Broadrick, every student will be using a Chrombook Convertible
for teaching and learning. The school will make arrangements for you to
purchase the PLD for your child’s/ward’s use in school. The vendor has
been identified based on the choice of device determined by the school
from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The PLD bundle includes
a warranty and insurance.</p>
