Dear Parents/Guardians

7 March 2023 is Blended Learning Day. As mentioned in Broadrick’s Term 1 Letter to Parents dated 3 January 2023, Secondary 2, 3 and 4 & 5 students will be having BL-HBL, and are to remain at home to do their HBL lessons. Secondary 1 will report to school. Lessons will be conducted as per their timetable.

With regards to students doing HBL, we would like to seek your assistance to support your child/ward by ensuring that he/she completes his/her assigned work.  Instructions will be given via Google Classroom.

We thank you for your support and if there are any queries, please do not hesitate to contact your child’s Form Teachers or e-mail : Mr Foo Siang Keng (foo_siang_keng@moe.edu.sg) or Mdm Caroline Wong (wong_yuet_ching_caroline@moe.edu.sg).

 

Let’s work together to nurture future ready learners!
