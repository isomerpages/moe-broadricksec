<p><strong>Does my child need to buy a laptop/mobile device as part of school programme when he/she joins the school? </strong>
<br>The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched by MOE in
March 2020 to make digital learning more inclusive by equipping students
with the digital skills needed to be future-ready.</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, the Personalised Digital Learning Programme
(PDLP) ensures that every secondary school student owns a school-prescribed
Personal Learning Device (PLD). This was rolled out progressively, with
full implementation by end-2021.</p>
<p>At Broadrick Secondary, all students will use a <strong>Chromebook Convertible</strong> to
support teaching and learning. The school will work with you to arrange
the purchase of this device for your child/ward.</p>
<p>The chosen vendor was selected from MOE’s panel of approved suppliers
based on the school’s device specifications. The PLD bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A 3-year warranty, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance coverage for added protection</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
