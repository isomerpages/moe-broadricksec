<p>As I look back on 2024, I am filled with gratitude for this year of new
beginnings at Broadrick—a year marked by growth, purpose and a sense of
community. It has been an honour to serve as your Principal and to work
alongside a vibrant community of staff, students, parents, alumni and partners
who are committed to shaping a distinctive identity for our school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the heart of our shared journey in 2024 was the establishment of GRC
education, an initiative founded on the pillars of Gratitude, Respect,
and Compassion. These values are more than aspirations; they shape our
daily experiences and interactions, reminding us to look beyond ourselves
and embrace a spirit of empathy and mutual respect. Together, we have laid
a strong foundation, setting the stage for Broadrick’s future as a choice
school that nurtures character, resilience, and future-readiness in every
student.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This journey began with an overwhelming support of our stakeholders, which
has inspired and sustained us along the way. Your commitment and partnership
have been invaluable in bringing our vision to life. We collaborated to
ensure that every voice was heard, as a result, we started 2024 with not
only a clear vision but also a united purpose that reflects the heart of
Broadrick.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, we also introduced innovative structures, including a revised
timetable designed to foster self-directed learning and cultivate independence.
These changes underscore our commitment to prepare Broadricians for a dynamic,
ever-evolving world, shaping them into leaders with integrity and strength
of character.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My heartfelt appreciation goes out to everyone who has been a part of
this journey. Together, we have set Broadrick on a path of promise, and
I am excited for the future we are building. As we continue to nurture
Gratitude, Respect and Compassion in all that we do, I look forward to
many more milestones in the years to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let’s keep moving forward, united by the values that define us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Ng Tiong Nam</p>
<p>Principal</p>
