<p>As we step confidently into 2026, Broadrick Secondary School continues
to build on the strong foundations laid over fifty-five remarkable years.
Our story has always been shaped by the values that define us—<strong>Gratitude, Respect, and Compassion (GRC</strong>)—values
that guide everything we believe, teach, and strive to embody.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong> grounds us in our heritage. We honour the pioneering
leaders and former principals whose vision and dedication shaped Broadrick
into the school it is today. Their commitment laid the foundations of a
culture centred on character, purpose, and service. We remain deeply appreciative
of the legacy they have entrusted to us.</p>
<p><strong>Respect</strong> anchors our mission. Our motto, “Ready to Serve,”
is more than a reminder—it is a way of life. In a world marked by constant
change, we hold firmly to the values that guide us in nurturing young people
who are thoughtful, resilient, and ready to contribute meaningfully to
society. At Broadrick, learning goes beyond academic success; it is about
developing integrity, humility, and strength of character.</p>
<p><strong>Compassion </strong>weaves through the fabric of our community.
We believe that education is not only about acquiring knowledge but about
shaping the whole person—their dreams, challenges, and unique strengths.
Compassion drives us to recognise each student’s potential and to cultivate
not only capable learners but caring individuals who uplift others.</p>
<p>Our strength lies in the collective effort of our Broadrick village—dedicated
teachers, committed support staff, trusting parents and Parent Support
Group (PSG), School Advisory Committee (SAC), and Broadrick alumni. Your
support reflects the very <strong>GRC </strong>values we uphold and enriches
the experiences of every Broadrician.</p>
<p>As we prepare our students for a rapidly evolving future, <strong>GRC</strong> remains
at the heart of our work. These values guide us as we innovate, grow, and
equip our young people to thrive in a dynamic world—anchored, confident,
and ready to make a positive impact.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to serve this community. As we look ahead, I am confident
that the next chapter of Broadrick’s story will be one of continued excellence,
service, and growth—written together, guided always by <strong>gratitude, respect, and compassion.</strong>
</p>
<p>May 2026 be a year where we continue to build, uplift, and inspire together.</p>
<p>Mr Ng Tiong Nam</p>
<p>Principal</p>
