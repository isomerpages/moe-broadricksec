The Broadrick Alumni (BA) was set up in 1974 to provide a platform for former students to maintain close relationship with our alma mater and schoolmates. We organise a wide range of activities for our members. These include Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, badminton, line-dance and karaoke. Members also actively take part in school activities such as Speech and Prize Giving Day and Teachers’ Day Celebration. The BA has contributed in cash and kind to support various school programmes such as Sudoku Competition and Night Study. Come join us to reminisce the good old times and to contribute to our alma mater! [Click here!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/broadrickalumni)
